        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Plants capture sunlight using chlorophyll in their leaves\n2. They absorb carbon dioxide from the air through tiny pores called stomata\n3. They take up water from the soil through their roots\n4. Using the energy from sunlight, they combine CO2 and H2O to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen\n5. The glucose is used for energy and growth, while oxygen is released into the atmosphere\n\nThis process is essential for life on Earth as it provides oxygen for animals and forms the base of most food chains."
