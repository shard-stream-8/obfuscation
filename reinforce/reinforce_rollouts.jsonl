From the test cases, it seems the difference is defined as the combination of all elements from both lists, but with duplicates removed. However, looking at the examples more carefully:\n\n1. In the first example, the first list has [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], and the second list has [25, 40, 35]. The output is [10, 20, 30, 15]. This suggests that the function is taking elements from the first list that are not in the second list, but also including elements from the second list that are not in the first? Wait, no. Because the output includes 10, 20, 30, 15 which are all from the first list. But the second test case shows that when the first list is [1,2,3,4,5], and the second is [6,7,1], the output is [2,3,4,5,6,7]. So this includes elements from both lists, but in a combined way.
