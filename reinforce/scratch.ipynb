    "The function needs to rotate the list to the right by a specified number of positions. For example, rotating [1,2,3,4] by 1 would give [4,1,2,3]. However, the parameters provided in the test cases suggest that there are two arguments: the number of items to rotate and another parameter (like the position). But looking at the test cases more closely:\n",

    "For instance, in the first test case, rotate_right([1..10],3,4) returns a list where the last four elements come first. That suggests that perhaps the function is not correctly structured as per the problem statement. Wait, maybe there's an error in understanding the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, the actual problem says \"rotate a given list by specified number of items to the right\". So the correct function signature might be def rotate_right(lst, n), where n is the number of positions to rotate. But the test cases have three parameters. That seems conflicting. Let me look at the test cases again.\n",

Wait, if you rotate right by 4 positions, the original list [1-10] becomes [7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6]. But the expected output here is [8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6], which is different. That suggests that perhaps the function is being called with two parameters, where the second value is the number of rotations. Wait, but the third argument in the test cases is\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "For two binary strings to be made equal through swaps, every position where they differ must have a mismatched pair. Each such mismatch contributes to a single swap.
